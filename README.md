# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – The Odin Project

A simple browser-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

This project uses a modular, object-oriented approach to separate game logic and UI, making the codebase easy to understand and extend.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)
- DOM manipulation
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- The `Gameboard` object handles the internal board state.
- The `Player` object stores player information (name and marker).
- The `Game` object checks for winning conditions and ties.
- A `playTurn()` function ties everything together, listening for user clicks, switching turns, and updating the UI accordingly.
